## Ideas Generated (YOLO Batch 1) - **[REJECTED]**

> [!WARNING]
> These ideas were rejected for being too "Arcade/Capitalist" and conflicting with the "Cozy/Safe Haven" and "Productivity" pillars defined in the GDD.

### Idea: The Vault (Rejected)
**Reason:** Too aggressive/active. 

### Idea: Money Hose (Rejected)
**Reason:** Violates "No Clicker" rule.

### Idea: Inflation Crisis (Rejected)
**Reason:** Introducing stress violates "Sérénité Productive".

### Idea: The Golden Finger (Rejected)
**Reason:** Relying on active clicking violates passive income core.

## Ideas Generated (YOLO Batch 2 - Aligned with GDD)

### Idea: Rainy Day Mode
**Source Technique:** Environmental Storytelling
**Core Loop:** Syncs with real-world weather API. When it rains IRL, it rains on the bakery window. 
**Cozy Factor:** Adds "Safe Haven" feeling -> Warm inside, cold outside. Chips curls up near the radiator.

### Idea: The "Purr" Haptic
**Source Technique:** Game Feel Playground
**Core Loop:** When you pet Chips (cursor hover/rub), the window vibrates slightly at a low frequency (visual purring).
**Novelty:** Simulates physical connection with the companion without needing a controller rumble.

### Idea: Seasonal Decorations (Auto-Glow)
**Source Technique:** Aesthetic Experience
**Core Loop:** Shop lights turn on automatically at user's local sunset. Fairy lights appear in winter.
**Novelty:** The game lives in the user's time zone, reinforcing the "Lifestyle Companion" aspect.

### Idea: The Morning Receipt
**Source Technique:** Ritual Design
**Core Loop:** When opening the app in the morning, a thermal printer sound plays and a small receipt prints out summarizing yesterday's earnings.
**Novelty:** "Sérénité Productive" -> Validates the previous day's effort before starting a new one.

### Idea: Plant Growth Cycle (Selected & Refined)
**Source Technique:** Slow Gaming + User Request
**Core Loop:**
1.  **Acquisition (Creative Mode)**: A dedicated **"Garden Shop"** button opens a catalog. Seeds, Pots, and Soil are **100% FREE**. The goal is creativity, not cost.
2.  **Interaction**: Click placed pot -> Open "Care Window" (Water, Prune, Decorate).
3.  **Growth**: Plants grow 1 stage per real-day (if watered).
4.  **Decoration**: Pots can be placed ANYWHERE (Desk, Shelves, Floor) via drag-and-drop.
**Visuals**: "Nano Banana" prompts will be used to generate consistent growth stages (Sprout -> Lush).

## Complementary "Cozy" Features

### Idea: Propagation Station ("Bouturage")
**Concept**: When you "Prune" a mature plant, you get a **Cutting**.
**Loop**: Place the cutting in a glass jar of water (new item). Watch roots grow over 3 days. Then plant it in a new pot.
**Cozy Factor**: Infinite free plants from care, encouraging gifting (or just more decorating).

### Idea: Sun & Shadow
**Concept**: Plants react to placement.
**Loop**: Some plants love the window (Sun), others prefer the dark corner (Shadow).
**Feedback**: A happy plant (right spot) produces a tiny "shiny" particle occasionally. A sad plant droops slightly.
**Novelty**: Giving "agency" to the plants makes them feel alive.

### Idea: The Herbarium (Collection)
**Concept**: A page in the "Grimoire/Book" where you press a leaf from each fully grown plant species.
**Reward**: A beautiful illustration and a stamp date of when you grew it.
